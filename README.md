Introduction
“The Retail Sales Index (RSI) is a base-weighted index measuring monthly movements in the average weekly retail turnover of retailers in Great Britain.”. The Retail Sales Index is a very important parameter and its future value prediction is found beneficial for both retail store owners and its stakeholders. An Article on Sales Forecasting for US Retail Firms states that Retail Sales forecasting  make retail managers better at understanding customer behaviors, optimizing inventory, and anticipating demand. By these ways, it is expected to help retail businesses manage operational efficiencies in adapting strategies. (Wang & Gu, 2022).

Aim
This project aims to forecast the Retail Sales Index (RSI) in the UK using historical time-series data with the underlying influence of key economic factors, including the UK Bank Rate, GBP to USD Exchange Rate, and UK GDP Index after analysing their correlation.

Objectives
This analysis focuses on three key objectives:
a.	Examine the correlation between historical economic indicators, such as GDP Index, Bank Rate, and GBP to USD Exchange Rate, with RSI data to understand their relationships and ability to use as exogenous variables for prediction.
b.	Perform predictive analysis using a OLS linear regression model to forecast the RSI by incorporating key economic factors as predictors.
c.	Perform predictive analysis using the ARIMAX model on the RSI time-series data to forecast future trends based on historical patterns.
